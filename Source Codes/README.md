## Please consider the following steps to generate these source codes
To have a practical example, the source code is explained using the seed dataset.

1. Loading the data
  
  - Data should load in the form of Seeds.m
  - dataset.samples includes the features
  - dataset.classes contains the coresponding labels

2. Prepration of data for 10-fold cross-validation strategy

  - Preprocessing_Ten_Fold.m partitions data into 10 disjoint folds.
  
3. Run the main source code
